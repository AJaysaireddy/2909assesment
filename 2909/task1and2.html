            A chatbot is a software or computer program that simulates human conversation or 
            "chatter" through text or voice interactions.
            Users in both business-to-consumer (B2C) and business-to-business (B2B) environments increasingly use chatbot 
            virtual assistants to handle simple tasks. Adding chatbot assistants reduces overhead costs, uses support staff
             time better and enables organizations to provide customer service during hours when live
              agents aren't available.

        How have chatbots evolved?
        Chatbots such as ELIZA and PARRY were early attempts to create programs that could at least 
        temporarily make a real person think they were conversing with another person. PARRY's effectiveness 
        was benchmarked in the early 1970s using a version of a Turing test; testers only correctly identified a
         human vs. a chatbot at a level consistent with making random guesses.
        Chatbots have come a long way since then. Developers build modern chatbots on AI technologies
        , including deep learning, NLP and machine learning (ML) algorithms. These chatbots require mass
        ive amounts of data. The more an end user interacts with the bot, the better its voice recognition predicts ap
        propriate responses.
        Chatbot use is on the rise in business and consumer markets.
